This allows you to view how OW users are connected via repo source collaborations and by the Meetups they attend. It also shows you how they are connected via skill sets. Use cases:

##For Recruiters
Find ways to connect to people on open web via their connections with other developers you know.

##For Developers
Find people via common interest (skills) or job title that are in their colloboration network or via meetups they attend. That allows you to find people in their desired career area for networking. For instance, people wishing to become a data scientist could explore their collaboration network to find data scientists, and then approach them for networking opportunities, career advice and to see if they're hiring.
  
##How to use:
Search for users via login or full name in the search box. Click on a user to initialize the network. Double click on a node to look at connected users and meetups they attend. Add skills from the left to either seed the network, or to see how people you've added to the network are connected via skill. You can drag, pan and zoom on the network graph using common commands for that. Hovering over a meetup or a user will show information about them
